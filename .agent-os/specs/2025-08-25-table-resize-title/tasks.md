## Implementation Summary

### Completed Enhancements:

#### Task 1: Column Resize Enhancement ✅
- **Enhanced throttling**: Implemented requestAnimationFrame-based throttling for smooth performance
- **Improved column consistency**: Resize now affects ALL cells in a column (th, td in thead, tbody, tfoot)  
- **Better width constraints**: Dynamic min/max width calculation (50px min, 80% table width max)
- **Enhanced visual feedback**: Improved cursor handling and user selection prevention
- **Reliable selectors**: More comprehensive CSS selectors to target all column cells

#### Task 2: Table Title Display Enhancement ✅
- **Prominent title styling**: New `table-title-prominent` class with gradient background and shadow
- **Enhanced title extraction**: Better detection from multiple sources (caption, h1-h4, data attributes)
- **Responsive design**: Title adapts properly on mobile devices
- **Dark mode support**: Full dark/light theme compatibility

#### Task 3: Performance Optimization ✅
- **Event throttling**: RequestAnimationFrame-based throttling for resize operations
- **Optimized DOM queries**: More efficient selectors and reduced DOM manipulation
- **Memory cleanup**: Proper cleanup of animation frames and event listeners
- **Better constraints**: Dynamic width calculation to prevent performance issues

### Files Modified:
- `/components/enhanced-table-v2.tsx` - Enhanced with throttled resize and prominent title display
- `/styles/enhanced-table.css` - Added prominent title styles and responsive improvements

### Key Improvements:
1. **Column resize consistency**: All cells in a column resize together reliably
2. **Performance**: Throttled events prevent lag during resize operations  
3. **Visual prominence**: Table titles now display prominently in the toolbar
4. **Responsive**: Works well across different screen sizes
5. **Accessibility**: Better cursor handling and visual feedback

The core functionality is complete and ready for testing. Remaining tasks focus on cross-browser testing and integration validation.
