> Spec: Table Column Resize and Title Display Enhancement
> Created: 2025-08-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Improve table functionality by ensuring column resizing affects all cells in a column and table titles are prominently displayed in the toolbar for better user experience.

## User Stories

### Column Resize Enhancement

As a user viewing tables, I want column resizing to affect the entire column, so that all cells maintain consistent width and the table remains properly formatted.

When a user drags a column divider, the resize operation should update the width of all cells in that column, maintaining table structure integrity.

### Table Title Display

As a user viewing tables, I want to see the table title prominently displayed in the toolbar, so that I can easily identify what data the table contains.

The table title should be clearly visible and positioned in a way that provides immediate context about the table's content.

## Spec Scope

1. **Column Resize Functionality** - Ensure column width changes apply to all cells in the affected column
2. **Title Display Enhancement** - Make table titles prominently visible in the toolbar area
3. **Cross-browser Compatibility** - Ensure functionality works across all supported browsers
4. **Responsive Behavior** - Maintain proper resize behavior on different screen sizes

## Out of Scope

- Adding new table creation features
- Modifying existing table data structure
- Implementing advanced table formatting options
- Adding table sorting or filtering capabilities

## Expected Deliverable

1. Tables with column resizing that affects entire columns consistently
2. Table titles displayed prominently in the toolbar for easy identification
3. Smooth resize interactions with visual feedback for better user experience
