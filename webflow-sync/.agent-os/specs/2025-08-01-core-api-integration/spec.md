## Overview

Implement the foundational JavaScript widget that fetches article content from the Directus API at admin.charlotteudo.org and renders it into Webflow DOM elements marked with data-article-id attributes.

## User Stories

### Article Content Display

As a website visitor, I want to see Charlotte UDO article content automatically loaded on the page, so that I can access the most up-to-date ordinance information without manual updates.

When I visit a page with article placeholders, the system should automatically detect elements with data-article-id attributes, fetch the corresponding content from the Directus API, and render it seamlessly before the page becomes visible. This ensures I see complete content without loading flashes or layout shifts.

### Developer Integration

As a web developer, I want to easily integrate Charlotte UDO content into Webflow pages, so that I can maintain dynamic content without complex backend infrastructure.

I should be able to add a simple script tag to Webflow's custom code section and mark any div with a data-article-id attribute to automatically pull in content. The widget should handle all API communication, error states, and rendering logic without requiring additional configuration.

## Spec Scope

1. **API Client Module** - Create a JavaScript module to handle GET requests to admin.charlotteudo.org/items/{articleID}
2. **DOM Scanner** - Implement functionality to find all elements with data-article-id attributes on page load
3. **Content Renderer** - Build a system to inject API content into target DOM elements safely
4. **Early Execution Handler** - Ensure the widget runs before visual page load to prevent content flash
5. **Error Management** - Provide graceful error handling with fallback messages for failed API calls

## Out of Scope

- Caching mechanisms (Phase 2)
- Loading state indicators or animations (Phase 2)
- Authentication or private content access
- Content editing or two-way synchronization
- TypeScript implementation (Phase 3)

## Expected Deliverable

1. A single JavaScript file that can be included via script tag in Webflow custom code that automatically populates all elements with data-article-id attributes with content from the Directus API
2. The script executes early enough to prevent visible layout shift or content flashing on page load
3. Failed API requests display a user-friendly error message instead of breaking the page layout
