### Decision

Build a lightweight JavaScript widget called Charlotte UDO Content Bridge that integrates Directus CMS content into Webflow sites. The widget will fetch article content from admin.charlotteudo.org API endpoints and render it in DOM elements marked with data-article-id attributes. The solution prioritizes SEO-friendly rendering and zero backend infrastructure requirements.

### Context

The Charlotte UDO website needs a way to dynamically display content managed in Directus CMS within their Webflow-hosted site. Current manual content synchronization is error-prone and time-consuming. The solution must work within Webflow's constraints (client-side only) while maintaining SEO value for municipal content that must be searchable and accessible.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Server-Side Rendering Integration**
   - Pros: Better SEO guarantee, faster initial render, more control over caching
   - Cons: Requires backend infrastructure, incompatible with Webflow hosting, additional costs

2. **iFrame Embedding**
   - Pros: Simple implementation, complete isolation
   - Cons: Poor SEO, accessibility issues, styling limitations, not responsive

3. **Manual Webflow CMS Migration**
   - Pros: Native Webflow features, no custom code needed
   - Cons: Dual content management, synchronization overhead, migration complexity

### Rationale

The client-side widget approach was chosen because:
- Works within Webflow's existing infrastructure without additional hosting costs
- Maintains single source of truth in Directus CMS
- Can be optimized for SEO through early execution and proper markup
- Provides flexibility for future enhancements
- Simple deployment through Webflow's custom code features

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Zero additional infrastructure costs
- Seamless integration with existing Webflow sites
- Content editors can work in familiar Directus environment
- Automatic content updates without manual synchronization
- Maintainable and version-controlled solution

**Negative:**
- Depends on client-side JavaScript (graceful degradation needed)
- Initial page load may show content flash if not optimized properly
- API rate limits could affect high-traffic pages
- SEO depends on proper implementation of early rendering
