---

## 4.1 PURPOSE

The Neighborhood 1 Zoning [10-Year Storm](#) respect the character and development patterns of Charlotte’s established residential neighborhoods and promote new residential neighborhood development in a manner that implements the City’s vision for the future. The N1-A through N1-E Zoning Districts allow for the development of single-family, duplex, and triplex dwellings on all lots. Additionally, quadraplex dwellings are allowed on arterial streets in these zoning districts when an affordable housing unit is provided within the dwelling. The N1-F Zoning District allows all dwelling types allowed in N1-A through N1-E Zoning Districts, as well as small-scale multi-family dwellings, and is intended for application typically on arterial streets within Neighborhood 1 Place Type.

Specific standards within each of the zoning districts address building form and promote context-sensitive, compatible neighborhood development. The Neighborhood 1 Zoning Districts also allow for select nonresidential uses, such as places of worship and educational facilities, and for the reuse of existing neighborhood commercial establishments under prescribed conditions.

**A. N1-A Neighborhood 1 Zoning District  
**The N1-A Zoning District allows for the development of residential dwellings on lots of 10,000 square feet or greater. The N1-A Zoning District is typically applied to established neighborhoods.

**B. N1-B Neighborhood 1 Zoning District  
**The N1-B Zoning District allows for the development of residential dwellings on lots of 8,000 square feet or greater. The N1-B Zoning District is typically applied to established neighborhoods.

**C. N1-C Neighborhood 1 Zoning District  
**The N1-C Zoning District allows for the development of residential dwellings on lots of 6,000 square feet or greater. The N1-C Zoning District is typically applied to established neighborhoods.

**D. N1-D Neighborhood 1 Zoning District  
**The N1-D Zoning District allows for the development of residential dwellings on lots of 3,500 square feet or greater.

1 Front setbacks shown on a plat recorded at the Register of Deeds shall supersede required zoning district front setbacks.

2 The following alternative setback standards may be used for an established blockface that is at least 25% developed or has at least four existing dwellings:

1\. A new single-family, duplex, or triplex dwelling on an established blockface shall be located at or behind the average of the front setback of the two closest residential buildings on the same blockface.

2\. In no case shall the minimum setback be less than ten feet or intrude into a required clear sight triangle at an intersection (Section 16.1).

3 In the case of a lot abutting both a local or collector street and a parallel arterial street (through lot), buildings shall orient toward the local or collector street.

4 In no case shall any building entry be located closer than six feet to an existing or proposed off-street public path or shared use path.

5 When the corner side setback is located along an arterial street, the corner side setback shall be subject to the minimum front setback dimension for the zoning district.

6 Street includes public and network-required private streets. For network-required private streets, front setback is measured from the back of curb, and shall be as indicated for the zoning district, plus an additional 14 feet.

7 Setbacks on existing local and collector streets shall be measured from the existing right-of-way. Setbacks on existing arterial and limited access streets shall be measured from two feet behind the future sidewalk as defined by the Charlotte Streets Map.

**D. Building Height  
**Building height standards govern the maximum heights of buildings, as applicable, and are intended to provide flexibility while maintaining appropriate transitions to adjacent areas.![](https://udo-backend-y1w0.onrender.com/assets/74765470-2f65-4c46-93e7-a46b89c8dae1.png)

1 The height and location of structures may be restricted by the limitations set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14 Part 77: Safe, Efficient Use, and Preservation of the Navigable Airspace.  A notice of proposed construction FAA Form 7460-1 must be filed with the FAA for construction or alteration that impacts any of the imaginary surfaces as defined in 14 CFR Part 77 or is more than 200 feet in height above the ground at its site at least 45 days prior to construction. The Aviation Department Planning Division may serve as a point of contact for information regarding building notification requirements and obstruction evaluation.

2 The maximum building height of any structure within 200 feet from the lot line of residential uses or vacant land in a Neighborhood 1 Place Type is limited as follows: Portions of a structure within the first 100 feet are limited to a maximum height of 50 feet. Building heights for all portions of a structure shall be measured from the average grade established for the whole building.

3 Building height may be increased by one foot for each additional one foot of building setback from required side and rear setbacks to a maximum height of 65 feet.

**![](https://udo-backend-y1w0.onrender.com/assets/4b3c07a0-7ac2-4690-93a5-e932e75059b6.jpg)**

**1\. Maximum Sidewall Height for Duplexes and Triplexes  
**All duplex and triplex buildings within the Neighborhood 1 Zoning Districts shall meet the maximum sidewall height regulations below.

1.  The sidewall height for all duplex and triplex buildings is limited to 20 feet. The sidewall height may be increased above 20 feet if the average height of the facing sidewalls of the single-family, duplex, or triplex buildings on both sides of the lot exceeds 20 feet. In such case, the sidewall height of the subject duplex or triplex building may be increased up to this average height.

**i.** Sidewalls shall be measured from the finished floor elevation at the ground floor to the eave or, if no eave is present on the building, to the bottom of the finished roof plane.

**ii.** For a lot that does not have single-family, duplex, or triplex buildings on both sides of the lot, the two closest single-family, duplex, or triplex buildings on the same blockface are used for averaging.

**iii.** When a sidewall height of greater than 20 feet is proposed, a sidewall height survey of the relevant single-family, duplex, or triplex buildings is required at the time of plan submittal.

**b.** If no single-family, duplex, or triplex buildings exist on the same blockface as a new duplex or triplex building under development, the maximum building height for the zoning district controls.

**c.** When an existing local street is extended for a new subdivision, as defined by Section 30.3.A, a 50’ wide landscape yard may be used to establish a new blockface if it meets the following:

**i.** The landscape yard shall be planted to Class B standards, per Table 20-2, for each 25’ of width of landscape yard.

**ii.** The landscape yard shall abut, and be the depth of, the last existing residential lot(s) prior to the new local street extension.

**iii.** The new blockface shall only be for the purposes of establishing the maximum sidewall height requirements of this Section.

**2\. Building Height Plane for Duplexes and Triplexes  
**In addition to the maximum building height requirement for the zoning district, all duplex and triplex buildings within the Neighborhood 1 Zoning Districts shall meet the building height plane regulations below.

**a.** One additional foot of height, above the maximum permitted sidewall height at the required minimum side setback, is allowed for each additional one foot in distance the portion of the building is located from the required minimum side setback. This establishes a building height plane of 45 degrees. The building height plane does not allow an increase in the maximum sidewall height. Buildings may not exceed the maximum building height of the zoning district.

**b.** Dormers and gable ends may extend into and through the 45 degree building height plane but shall comply with the maximum building height. The cumulative width of dormers extending into and through the building height plane shall be limited to 25% of the depth of the sidewall.

**BUILDING HEIGHT PLANE (DUPLEX AND TRIPLEX)**

## 4.5 ALTERNATIVE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT OPTIONS

**A. Conservation Residential Development  
**A conservation residential development permits a reduction in minimum lot size in exchange for the provision and conservation of green area and common open space beyond the requirements of this Ordinance. The purpose of the conservation residential development standards is to protect open space and/or natural resources and features through alternative development standards. The intent of the conservation residential development standards of this Section is to emphasize the importance of the conservation of natural areas and important habitats, enhance surface water quality, maintain and enhance tree canopy and provide useable common open space for residents.

**1\. Applicability  
**Conservation residential development is permitted in the N1-A, N1-B, and N1-C Zoning Districts. A conservation residential development site shall be a minimum of five acres. The conservation residential development provisions shall not be paired with the Voluntary Mixed Income incentives of Section 4.5.B. or the Compact Residential Development option of Section 4.5.C.

**2\. Development Standards  
**Where there are comparable development standards in the N1-A, N1-B, and N1-C Zoning Districts, the development standards below replace those development standards. All other applicable UDO standards apply unless stated otherwise.

**a. Site Layout  
****i.** All lots within a conservation residential development shall front a public street, common open space, or green area. All applicable emergency access requirements must be met regardless of lot frontage.

**ii.** A 25 foot Class B landscape yard shall be provided along the perimeter of a conservation residential development site, except for where the site abuts an existing public street or network required private street. The perimeter landscape yard shall not be in a lot or sublot and shall not count toward any required common open space. As an alternative, a 30 foot perimeter landscape yard that meets the planting standards of a Class B landscape yard per Table 20-2 may be counted toward green area credits if the standards of Section 20.15.E (Tree Save Standards) are also met.

**iii.** The maximum number of lots permitted within a conservation residential development is determined by the gross acreage of the site, exclusive of the rights-of-way for existing public streets, divided by the minimum lot area of the zoning district.

**iv.** Lots within the conservation residential development shall meet the standard lot requirements of the underlying zoning district with the exception of the following:

**(A)** Minimum lot area and minimum lot width may be reduced by 50%.

**(B)** Maximum building coverage does not apply to lots of 5,000 square feet or less.

**v.** Minimum setbacks apply as follows:

**(A)** A minimum side setback of five feet applies to all lots within a conservation residential development.

**(B)** A minimum corner side setback of ten feet applies to all corner lots within a conservation residential development.

**(C)** Front and rear setbacks may be reduced by 50% for all lots within the conservation residential development, unless otherwise specified below.

**(D)** Where a lot within a conservation residential development fronts on a common open space or green area, the front setback shall be five feet behind the property line abutting the common open space or green area.

**(E)** Where a garage is accessed from an alley and parking is not located between the garage and alley, the garage shall be located between five and seven feet from the edge of pavement of an alley. Where parking spaces are located between a garage and an alley, the garage shall be located at least 20 feet from the edge of pavement of the alley.

**(F)** The driveway requirements of Section 19.6.A.1 are applicable in a conservation residential development unless otherwise noted in this Section.

**(G)** Where a lot within the conservation residential development abuts a public or network-required private street at the perimeter of the conservation residential development, minimum front setback and minimum lot width shall be in accordance with the underlying zoning district requirements.

**(H)** Where common open space abuts a public or network-required private street at the perimeter of a conservation residential development, the minimum front setback and minimum lot width for any lot fronting on this common open space shall be in accordance with the underlying zoning district requirements.

**(B)** No common parking lot shall contain more than ten parking spaces.

**b. Conservation Protection Area**

**i.** A minimum of 40% of a conservation residential development shall comprise conservation protection area. For the conservation protection area, 30% of the overall site shall be green area and 10% of the overall site shall be common open space. The 30% green area shall be inclusive of the base 15% requirement for green area per Section 20.15.D. The standards of Table 16-2 for common open space do not apply for conservation residential development. Additional standards for green area and common open space are as follows:

**(A)** Green area credits shall be used to achieve required green area. Green area credits are based on the corresponding multipliers for each credit and found in Table 20-5.

**(B)** Trees on private lots or sublots shall not count toward required green area.

**(C)** Dimensions of required green areas are subject to the requirements of Section 20.15.

**(D)** Green areas fronted by residential lots shall have a minimum width of 50 feet.

**(E)** Required common open space areas need not be contiguous, but each common open space area shall have a minimum dimension of at least 50 feet in all dimensions.

**(F)** All required common open space areas shall have a minimum frontage of 50 feet on a public street.

**(G)** At least one common open space area shall be accessible from all residential lots in the conservation residential development within a 1,000 foot radius of the common open space area. This radius is measured in a straight line from the lot line, without regard for street, sidewalk or trail connections, to the nearest point of the open space. Multiple common open space areas may be needed to meet this requirement.

**(H)** Easements for above-ground utilities located within the site area shall not count toward required common open space.

**(I)** The required common open space shall be improved for either active or passive use.

**(1)** The required common open space area shall be improved with grass, live groundcover, shrubs, plants, trees, or usable outdoor hardscape features, such as courtyards, walkways, seating areas, patios, or fountains/water features.

**iv.** Green area and common open space shall have no development rights except when these areas are improved for active or passive recreational purposes.

**B. Voluntary Mixed-Income Residential Development  
**A voluntary mixed-income residential development allows for an increase in development intensity in exchange for the provision of a mixture of affordable and market-rate housing units, expanding housing options and opportunities within the City. The voluntary mixed-income residential development provisions shall not be paired with the conservation residential development incentives of Section 4.5.A.

**1\. Applicability  
**Voluntary mixed-income residential development is permitted in the N1-A, N1-B, N1-C, and N1-D Zoning Districts.

**2\. Development Bonus  
**In exchange for setting aside affordable housing units, voluntary mixed-income residential developments may receive a bonus allowing for the development of property in accordance with the standards of a zoning district of greater intensity as follows:

**a.** Property zoned the N1-A Zoning District may be developed in accordance with the standards

of the N1-C Zoning District.

**b.** Property zoned the N1-B Zoning District may be developed in accordance with the standards

of the N1-D Zoning District.

**c.** Property zoned the N1-C Zoning District may be developed in accordance with the standards

of the N1-E Zoning District.

**d.** Property zoned the N1-D Zoning District may be developed in accordance with the standards

of the N1-E Zoning District.

*An example of a calculation of bonus lots is as follows: If the N1-A Zoning District allows 100 lots and the N1-C Zoning District allows 167 lots, then there are 67 bonus lots. (167 lots minus 100 lots).*

**3\. Affordability Set-Aside  
****a.** All units constructed on 50% of the bonus lots accommodated through the development bonus shall be developed as affordable units set aside for households earning 80% Area Median Income (AMI) or less. The period of affordability shall be 15 years for rental properties and the City or a nonprofit shall have first right of refusal for for-sale properties.

**b.** AMI averaging is permitted; however, no unit designated as affordable shall be set aside for households earning more than 100% AMI.

**c.** For lots on arterial streets, any affordable units required for a quadraplex dwelling are in addition to the required number of affordable units in item a above.

**4\. Development Standards  
****a.** A minimum contiguous development site of one acre is required for a voluntary mixed-income residential development. No fewer than two affordable units may be developed as part of a voluntary mixed-income development receiving a development bonus.

**b.** Development standards applicable to a voluntary mixed-income development shall be those of the zoning district achieved through the development bonus.

**c.** Affordable housing units provided as a component of the voluntary mixed-income residential development shall be distributed throughout the development, not concentrated in any one structure or area of the site, unless the total affordable housing units in the development is five or fewer.

**5\. Compliance and Monitoring  
**Voluntary mixed-income residential developments are subject to monitoring to ensure continued compliance with the standards of this section, and in accordance with Section 2.1 of the UDO Zoning Administration Manual.

**C. Compact Residential Development  
**A compact residential development permits a reduction in lot size and setbacks in exchange for the provision of common open space beyond the requirements of this Ordinance. The purpose of these compact residential development standards is to align residential development standards with current development and design patterns to support increased access to housing.

**1\. Applicability**

**a.** Compact residential development is permitted in the N1-A, N1-B, N1-C, and N1-D Zoning Districts. A compact residential development site shall include at least one parcel with a minimum size of two acres as of June 1, 2023. If the site does not include at least one parcel of two acres or more, assembly of multiple parcels into a parcel of two acres or more is allowed when either of the following conditions are met:

**i.** At least one of the parcels in the assemblage has frontage on an arterial street of four lanes or more, per the Charlotte Streets Map.

**ii.** The assemblage includes no more than three separate parcels to achieve the minimum two-acre requirement. If the minimum two-acre requirement is met, additional parcels may be added to the assemblage.

**b.** The compact residential development option shall not be used on a parcel, or a portion thereof, included in the 65 DNL contour on the most recently published Airport Noise Exposure Map for Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, nor the Critical and Protected Watershed Areas (Article 23).

**c.** The compact residential development provisions shall not be paired with the Conservation Residential Development option of Section 4.5.A or the Voluntary Mixed Income incentives of Section 4.5.B.

**2\. Development Standards  
**Where there are comparable development standards in the N1-A, N1-B, N1-C, and N1-D zoning districts, the development standards below replace those development standards. All other applicable UDO standards apply unless otherwise stated.

**a. Site Layout  
****i.** All lots within a compact residential development shall front a public street or common open space. However, no more than 30% of residential lots on the development site shall front on common open space. All applicable emergency access requirements must be met regardless of lot frontage.

**ii.** A 25 foot Class B landscape yard shall be provided along the perimeter of a compact residential development site where the site abuts the Neighborhood 1 Place Type, except for where the site abuts an existing public street or network required private street. The perimeter landscape yard shall not be in a lot or sublot and shall not count toward any required common open space. As an alternative, a 30 foot perimeter landscape yard that meets the planting standards of a Class B landscape yard per Table 20-2 may be counted toward green area credits if the standards of Section 20.15.E (Tree Save Standards) are also met.

**iii.** No landscape yard is required between lots fronting an external street and abutting property in a Neighborhood 1 Place Type. This allowance does not exempt a compact residential development from the landscape yard requirements of Sections 20.10 and 20.11.

**iv.** Lots within a compact residential development shall meet the following standards:
