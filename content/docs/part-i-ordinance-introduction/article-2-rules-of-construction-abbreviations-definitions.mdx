**Use, Accessory**. A use located on the same site as the principal use and is incidental and subordinate to the principal use.

**Use, Principal**. The main use of a structure or lot.

**Use, Temporary**. A use established for a fixed period of time. Such use shall be discontinued upon the expiration of such time, that does not involve the construction or alteration of any permanent structure.
