## **3.1 PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY**

Zoning regulations control the use, physical development, and placement of structures on land within the City of Charlotte and its extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ). Regulations are intended to protect the health, safety, and welfare of all Charlotte residents and those that provide vital services to the community, and to provide for the orderly development of land in alignment with the City’s established land use policies as articulated within the adopted Comprehensive Plan and other development related policies adopted by the Charlotte City Council.

## **3.2 ZONING DISTRICT TRANSLATION**

The conventional zoning district classifications in effect before the effective date of June 1, 2023 of this Ordinance are translated as shown in Table 3-1: Zoning Districts Translation to the zoning districts of this Ordinance. The new standards set forth in this Ordinance for these zoning districts shall apply to all properties within such zoning districts.

## **3.4 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP**

**A. Location of Zoning Districts  
**The location and boundaries of the base and overlay zoning districts established by this Ordinance are set forth in the Official Zoning Map (“Zoning Map”), as periodically amended. The Zoning Map maintained by the Planning Department, and all the notations, references, and other information shown thereon are incorporated into, and made part of, this Ordinance.

**B. Interpretation of Zoning Map  
**Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of the zoning districts shown on the Zoning Map, the following rules shall be used to interpret the Zoning Map:

**1.** Where the Zoning Map shows a boundary line located within a street or alley right-of-way, railroad, or utility line right-of-way, easement, navigable or non-navigable waterway, or other planimetric feature, it shall be considered to be in the center of the right-of-way, easement, waterway, or other planimetric feature. If the actual location of such right-of-way, easement, waterway, or planimetric feature varies slightly from the location as shown on the Zoning Map, then the actual location shall control.

**2.** Where a map shows a boundary line as being located a specific distance from a street or alley right-of-way, railroad or utility line right-of-way, easement, navigable or non-navigable waterway, or other planimetric feature, this distance shall control.

**3.** Where a map shows a zoning district boundary to approximately coincide with a property line or city, town, county or state border, the property line or city, town, county, or state border shall be the zoning district boundary, unless otherwise indicated.

**4.** In instances when an approved rezoning petition included detailed information regarding a boundary line, such information shall be used as the correct boundary line location.

**5.** Where detailed information regarding a boundary line is not available, and where a map shows a zoning district boundary to not coincide or approximately coincide with any street or alley right-of-way, railroad or utility line right-of-way, easement, navigable or non-navigable waterway, other planimetric feature, or municipal border, and no dimensions are shown, the location of the boundary shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the map.

**6.** If, because of error or omission in the Zoning Map, any property within the jurisdiction of this Ordinance is not shown as being in a zoning district, a zoning district classification of N1-A shall be established for the property.

**7.** In instances where none of the above methods are sufficient to resolve the boundary location, the Zoning Administrator may interpret the reasonable maintenance of a regular boundary to establish the boundary location.

**8.** Interpretation of information on the Zoning Map will be made by the Zoning Administrator. Appeals of the Zoning Administrator’s interpretation may be made to the UDO Board of Adjustment. The Zoning Administrator will evaluate any alleged Zoning Map error using all available materials and records for the subject and adjacent properties. These materials include, but are not limited to, the following:

**a.** The tax map, current or historic.

**b.** Legal descriptions of properties or boundaries.

**c.** Historical zoning maps.

**d.** Approved rezoning petition information.

**e.** Tax records, current or historic.

**f.** Zoning and special use permit case files.

**g.** Official maps from other jurisdictions.

**h.** Topographic and planimetric maps and aerial photos.

**i.** Other documentable information from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.

## **3.5 APPLICABILITY OF FRONTAGES**

**b.** The following dimensional regulations, design regulations, and other aspects of zoning districts frequently controlled by frontages shall not apply to accessory buildings or structures on any portions of a lot located 250’ or greater from a street, platted right-of-way, or public open space establishing the frontage, as defined by Article 2 of this Ordinance.

## **3.6 ALTERNATIVE STANDARDS FOR LOTS WITH MULTIPLE FRONTAGES**

If a lot has three or more frontages, any frontage other than a primary frontage may be classified as the “last frontage” and the alternative standards, in their entirety, may apply. If all frontages are primary frontages, the lowest frontage in hierarchy becomes the “last frontage”. In no instance shall a transit station, off-street public path, or public park frontage be deemed the “last frontage”.
